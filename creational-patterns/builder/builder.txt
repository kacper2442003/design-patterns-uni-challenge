Builder Pattern 
The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different types or variations of objects.

My example:
The Builder pattern is used to construct two different types of characters: MaleCharacter and a FemaleCharacter. Both of these are built through dedicated builders.
