Factory Method
It is a creational design pattern that lets a superclass define an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Instead of calling a constructor directly, the pattern uses a dedicated factory method (like create()) to handle instantiation, keeping the code flexible and decoupled.

My example:
Using one class object to create different items objects.
