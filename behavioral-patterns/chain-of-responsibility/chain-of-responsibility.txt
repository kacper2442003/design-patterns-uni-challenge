The Chain of Responsibility Pattrn
It is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

My example:
The pattern is used to authenticate users based on different permission levels: regular user, user plus, and super user. The AuthenticationHandler interface defines a common method for authentication, and each concrete handler checks whether a given user meets the required permission level.
