Observer pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern used to create a one-to-many dependency between objects. This means that when one object changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

My example:
Game mechanic: when player enters or leaves a room, the room acting as observer is notified and updates itself accordingly.
