Proxy Pattern 
It is a structural design pattern that acts as a controlled substitute for another object (called the "real subject"). It implements the same interface as the real object but adds extra functionality.

My example:
CalculationsProxy wraps CalculationsData and passes calculations to real object, caches last result and adds a helper method displayResult().
