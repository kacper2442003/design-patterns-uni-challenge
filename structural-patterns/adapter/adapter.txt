Adapter Pattern
The Adapter is a structural design pattern that bridges incompatible interfaces by converting one interface into another. It acts like a "translator" allowing classes with different interfaces to collaborate.

My example:
LegacyPrinterAdapter class which "translates" old LegacyPrinter's method to adapt to Printer Interface method.
